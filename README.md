Drum Kit 

A simple creation that was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
for personal learning purposes.The drumkit is able to play a drum 
or crash sound depending on which button is pressed. The sounds 
can be pressed using clicking on the on-screen buttons with touch 
screen or with your mouse cursor. 

The index.html file hold the base of the website because all the 
buttons are added using HTML.

The styles.css file contains all the animations that can change the
color of the buttons that are clicked using only CSS.

The index.js file carries the code that plays the sound when a 
certain button is pressed and also changes the color of the button 
that is pressed

This website was made possible with Dr. Angela's web development course
